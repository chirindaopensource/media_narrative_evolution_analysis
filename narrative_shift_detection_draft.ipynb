        "## Introduction\n",
        "\n",
        "This project provides a Python implementation of the methodologies presented in the 2025 paper \"Narrative Shift Detection: A Hybrid Approach of Dynamic Topic Models and Large Language Models.\" The core of this repository is the iPython Notebook `narrative_shift_detection_draft.ipynb`, which contains a comprehensive suite of functions to analyze narrative evolution in longitudinal text corpora.\n",
        "\n",
        "Analyzing how media narratives evolve over time is a critical task in computational social science, finance, and political economy. Traditional quantitative methods like topic modeling are scalable but often lack the semantic depth to understand complex narrative structures. Conversely, Large Language Models (LLMs) possess sophisticated language understanding but are computationally prohibitive to apply across entire large-scale corpora for continuous monitoring.\n",
        "\n",
        "This framework enables researchers to:\n",
        "\n",
        "- Detect significant narrative shifts in large text corpora\n",
        "- Identify the temporal moments when narratives change\n",
        "- Classify changes as \"content shifts\" or \"narrative shifts\" using the Narrative Policy Framework (NPF)\n",
        "- Provide computational efficiency through hybrid DTM-LLM architecture\n",
        "\n",
        "This codebase is intended for researchers and students in computational social science, journalism, political science, and related fields who require robust tools for quantitative narrative analysis.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Theoretical Background\n",
        "\n",
        "The implemented methods are grounded in the theoretical constructs combining Dynamic Topic Models (DTMs) and Large Language Models (LLMs):\n",
        "\n",
        "**Dynamic Topic Modeling:** Utilizes Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) with temporal coherence to track topic evolution over time. The pipeline implements:\n",
        "- Stable Topic Initialization to mitigate LDA stochasticity\n",
        "- Rolling Window LDA for temporal topic tracking\n",
        "- Statistical change point detection using bootstrap methods\n",
        "\n",
        "**Narrative Policy Framework (NPF):** Provides the theoretical foundation for classifying narrative changes into:\n",
        "- Content Shifts: Changes in topic focus or emphasis without fundamental narrative restructuring\n",
        "- Narrative Shifts: Deeper changes in how stories are framed, including character roles, plot structure, and moral positioning\n",
        "\n",
        "**Hybrid Architecture:** Combines the scalability of DTMs for corpus-wide analysis with the semantic depth of LLMs for targeted narrative interpretation, achieving both computational efficiency and analytical sophistication.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Features\n",
        "\n",
        "The provided iPython Notebook (`narrative_shift_detection_draft.ipynb`) implements a full pipeline for narrative shift detection, including:\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Input Validation:** Rigorous checks for input data schema, parameter types, and value ranges\n",
        "- **Text Preprocessing:** Advanced text cleaning, tokenization, and lemmatization using spaCy\n",
        "- **Stable Topic Initialization:** LDAPrototype algorithm for consistent topic model initialization\n",
        "- **Dynamic Topic Evolution:** RollingLDA implementation for temporal topic tracking\n",
        "- **Statistical Change Point Detection:** Bootstrap-based hypothesis testing for significant topic shifts\n",
        "- **Document Filtering:** Intelligent selection of relevant documents for LLM analysis\n",
        "- **LLM-based Narrative Analysis:** Structured prompting for narrative shift classification\n",
        "- **Performance Evaluation:** Comprehensive metrics comparing LLM classifications to human annotations\n",
        "- **Visualization Suite:** Time series plots, topic evolution charts, and performance summaries\n",
        "- **Comprehensive Reporting:** Detailed documentation of pipeline runs for reproducibility\n",
        "\n",
        "## Methodology Implemented\n",
        "\n",
        "The core analytical steps directly implement the hybrid DTM-LLM methodology:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Stable Topic Initialization**: Mitigates LDA stochasticity by training multiple models on a warm-up corpus and selecting the most stable representative model as a prototype.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Dynamic Topic Evolution**: Models topic evolution using a rolling window approach where topic-word distributions from previous time steps inform current models, ensuring temporal coherence while allowing adaptation.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Statistical Change Point Detection**: Applies bootstrap-based hypothesis testing to time series of topic-word distributions, detecting statistically significant abrupt shifts and identifying key words driving changes.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. **Document Filtering**: Selects the most relevant documents for each detected change point based on topic relevance scores and temporal proximity.\n",
        "\n",
        "5. **LLM-based Narrative Analysis**: Uses carefully engineered prompts to instruct an LLM (Llama 3.1 8B) to analyze changes, classify them according to NPF, and provide structured explanations in JSON format.\n",
        "\n",
        "6. **Performance Evaluation**: Compares LLM classifications against human annotations using standard metrics (accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score).\n",
        "\n",
        "## Core Components (Notebook Structure)\n",

        "With rapidly evolving media narratives, it has become increasingly critical to not just extract narratives from a given corpus but rather investigate, how they develop over time. While popular narrative extraction methods such as Large Language Models do well in capturing typical narrative elements or even the complex structure of a narrative, applying them to an entire corpus comes with obstacles, such as a high financial or computational cost. We propose a combination of the language understanding capabilities of Large Language Models with the large scale applicability of topic models to dynamically model narrative shifts across time using the Narrative Policy Framework. We apply a topic model and a corresponding change point detection method to find changes that concern a specific topic of interest. Using this model, we filter our corpus for documents that are particularly representative of that change and feed them into a Large Language Model that interprets the change that happened in an automated fashion and distinguishes between content and narrative shifts. We employ our pipeline on a corpus of The Wall Street Journal news paper articles from 2009 to 2023. Our findings indicate that a Large Language Model can efficiently extract a narrative shift if one exists at a given point in time, but does not perform as well when having to decide whether a shift in content or a narrative shift took place."

        "Okay, let's dissect this paper. From my perspective, this work attempts to bridge the gap between scalable, but somewhat superficial, topic modeling and the deep, but computationally intensive, understanding capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) for the specific task of detecting and characterizing *narrative shifts* over time. This is a pertinent problem, especially in fields like media studies, political economy, and indeed, financial market sentiment analysis where narratives can drive behavior.\n",

        "The primary goal is to develop a computationally feasible pipeline that can identify *when* and *how* narratives within a large text corpus (specifically news articles) change over time, distinguishing between mere content shifts and genuine narrative re-framings.\n",

        "\n",
        "*   **The Challenge:** Analyzing narrative evolution in large, longitudinal corpora is difficult.\n",
        "    *   **Traditional Topic Models (e.g., LDA):** Scalable for identifying thematic changes (word co-occurrence patterns) but lack nuanced understanding of narrative structure (characters, plot, moral, causality). Dynamic Topic Models (DTMs) can track topic evolution but still operate at the word-distribution level.\n",
        "    *   **Large Language Models (LLMs):** Possess sophisticated language understanding capabilities, potentially able to grasp complex narrative elements. However, applying them to an entire large corpus for continuous monitoring is often prohibitive due to computational cost and API expenses (if using commercial models). Training them from scratch on a specific corpus for temporal analysis is also impractical.\n",
        "*   **The Paper's Core Idea:** A hybrid approach. Use dynamic topic modeling as a \"first-pass filter\" to identify potential change points at scale, then deploy an LLM for a \"deep dive\" analysis on a small, curated set of documents surrounding these detected change points.\n",

        "    *   This involves training *N* LDA models and selecting the one with the highest average pairwise similarity to all other models (similarity based on cosine distance of topic-word distributions). This aims to yield a more stable and representative \"base\" set of topics.\n",
        "*   **B. RollingLDA for Dynamic Topic Evolution:**\n",
        "    *   Building on `LDAPrototype`, `RollingLDA` is used to model topic dynamics. It's a dynamic topic model that uses a rolling window approach.\n",
        "    *   It initializes on the first `w` time chunks (e.g., 12 months for yearly trends) and then, for subsequent time chunks, updates topic assignments and distributions based on information from the preceding `m` time chunks (e.g., 4 months for quarterly memory).\n",
        "    *   This allows topics to evolve while maintaining coherence, and is designed to be sensitive to abrupt changes, which is suitable for news media.\n",

        "    *   **Theoretical Grounding:** The explicit use of the Narrative Policy Framework to guide the LLM's interpretation is a significant strength, providing a structured and theoretically informed definition of \"narrative.\"\n",
        "    *   **Methodological Rigor in DTM:** The use of `LDAPrototype` and `RollingLDA` with `Topical Changes` demonstrates attention to the statistical challenges of dynamic topic modeling and change detection.\n",
        "    *   **Open-Source LLM:** Using a local, open-source LLM is practical for academic research with sensitive or copyrighted data.\n",
        "    *   **Promising for Explanation:** The LLM shows good capability in *explaining* a narrative shift once it's known to exist, by breaking it down into NPF components.\n",
        "\n",
        "*   **Weaknesses and Areas for Future Work:**\n",
        "    *   **Poor Discrimination:** The LLM's primary failure was in distinguishing narrative shifts from mere content shifts. The authors attribute this to \"hallucinatory behavior\" or an over-eagerness to satisfy the prompt's request for narrative elements. This is a common issue with LLMs; they are often \"too helpful.\"\n",
        "        *   *Suggestion:* This might be mitigated by more sophisticated prompting (e.g., explicitly allowing for \"no narrative shift\" as a primary valid output, perhaps with a confidence score) or a two-stage LLM process (first classify, then explain if classified as narrative). Fine-tuning a smaller LLM on this specific discrimination task could also be an avenue, though data-intensive.\n",
        "    *   **Document Filtering:** The strategy of using only 5 documents based on \"leave-one-out\" words is a heuristic. While it reduces LLM input, it might miss broader contextual cues or introduce bias. Exploring alternative filtering or summarization techniques before LLM input could be beneficial.\n",
        "    *   **Sensitivity to Parameters:** As acknowledged in the limitations, the DTM and change detection parameters (`w, m, z, K, alpha`) will influence the number and nature of detected changes, which in turn affects the LLM's input. Robustness checks across parameter settings would be valuable.\n",
        "    *   **Evaluation of \"Incorrectly Detected Changes\":** The study didn't evaluate how the LLM would respond if the `Topical Changes` model flagged a change point that human annotators deemed a false positive (i.e., no real change at all).\n",
        "    *   **Binary Nature of \"Narrative Shift\":** The current evaluation treats narrative shift as a binary phenomenon. In reality, shifts can be gradual or partial. A more nuanced evaluation framework for the \"degree\" of narrative shift could be developed.\n",
        "\n",
        "*   **Implications for CS, Math Finance, and Econometrics:**\n",
        "    *   **CS (NLP/AI):** Highlights the ongoing challenge of controlling LLM output and reducing hallucination, especially in analytical tasks requiring high fidelity. Prompt engineering and hybrid AI architectures remain key research areas.\n",
        "    *   **Math Finance/Econometrics:** The dynamic topic modeling and change-point detection components are directly relevant to time-series analysis of textual data. If the discrimination problem can be solved, this pipeline could be adapted to track shifts in economic narratives (e.g., around inflation, recession fears, policy changes) from financial news or regulatory filings, potentially offering leading indicators or qualitative insights for quantitative models. The NPF's emphasis on \"moral\" and \"blame\" could be particularly interesting for understanding sentiment and its drivers.\n",
        "\n",
        "**In essence:** This paper presents a well-structured and thoughtful approach to a complex problem. The DTM front-end is solid. The LLM back-end shows promise for interpretation but struggles with classification. The main takeaway is that while LLMs are powerful for understanding, guiding them to make accurate, high-stakes *judgments* (like \"is this a narrative shift or not?\") remains a significant hurdle that requires more than just clever prompting; it may require more fundamental advances in LLM reasoning or specialized fine-tuning."

For example, the content of a story about fracking told by a Scottish environmentalist is certainly different from the story told by a right-wing populist who attacks a public agency in Switzerland. However, these stories share common structural elements: They take place in a setting, contain characters, have a plot, and often champion a moral.\" Keep in mind that a moral must feature a value judgement. When asked to specifiy a moral of a narratives, you must refer to this value judgement or note that there is no moral and thus no narrative! A narrative change must satisfy the four structural criteria, while a content change can simply be caused by an event that shifts the focus of the topic without a clear narrative.
